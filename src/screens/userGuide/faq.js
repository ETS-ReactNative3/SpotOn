					<h4>What can I do with SpotON?</h4>

					<ul>
						<li>
							By looking at the performances of existing spots,
							you can identify the highly performing elements of
							the advertisements for their market, which can be
							exploited to boost the success for your upcoming
							spot.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you have multiple options for the spot (e.g.
							different cuisines, different directions, different
							visuals, etc.), you can use our tool to test them
							and identify which option can lead to the best
							result in the market before you air your spot.
						</li>
						<li>
							Using the SpotON results from testing new ad ideas,
							you can measure and compare their performance to
							existing ones and optimize future spots.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<h4>
						How are the weighted and percentile scores calculated?
					</h4>

					<p>There are two different scores in the reports.</p>

							KPI formula with the survey results (0%≤x≤100%)
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Percentile scores:</strong> calculated from
							the weighted score indicating relative standing
							among the herd (0th≤x≤100th)
						</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

					<h4>
						Why can’t I see the country norm when looking at the
						charts
					</h4>

					<p>

						On what criteria have the spots been selected for
						testing?
					</h4>

					<p>
						We have four different categories; ‘Food delivery’,
						‘Non-food offline’, ‘Offline food’, ‘Online ordering
						(non-food)’. We selected benchmarking TV spots from
						well-known brands, including competitors and similar
						target groups, which have already aired and spent highly
						on advertising.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h4>Can we add new spots to the existing ones?</h4>

						Yes, adding new spots is relatively easy when the market
